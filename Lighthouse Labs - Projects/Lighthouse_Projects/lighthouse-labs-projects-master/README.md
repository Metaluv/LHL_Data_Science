# Lighthouse Labs Mini-Projects

Repository containing mini-projects completed at Lighthouse Labs Data Science Bootcamp.

## Mini-Project 1: Transport of London API, TMDB Movie API
This project involved extracting information from London's Transport API and TMDB Movie API to answer some important questions. This mini-project serves as an exercise to practice Python for data science and APIs.

## Mini-Project 2: Explore Vancouver!
In this project, I used Yelp and Foursquare's API to identify some top local hot spots in downtown Vancouver. Then, I implemented the traveling salesman algorithm to determine the shortest distance to visit all downtown spots so people can visit some of the best places in Vancouver with the shortest amount of time as possible.

## Mini-Project 3: Unsupervised Learning - Customer Banking Behaviour
In this project, I used unsupervised learning approaches to identify patterns in banking behaviour. I looked into the banking patterns of customers, namely transactions in their credit and savings accounts, and provided recommendations to improve banking experience.

## Mini-Project 4: Supervised Learning - Loan Prediction Status
In this project, I developed a web application that predicts whether a candidate is eligible for a home loan. The web-app was deployed using Flask and AWS. 

## Mini-Project 5: Deep Learning - Language Translator
In this project, I utilized recurrent neural networks to develop a machine translator from French to English.
